# ðŸŸ¢ What is being built?

- We are creating a registration form in React that has:
  - Username input
  - Password input
  - Confirm password input
  - Custom validation for each
  - Accessibility features (so screen readers can read out errors and instructions)
  - Success message after submit
  - Connection to backend using Axios

# Dependencies used:

- `font-awesome`: Font Awesome is a popular library that provides a huge collection of scalable vector icons. Instead of using image files, these icons are essentially fonts, which makes them easy to style with CSS and ensures they look sharp at any size.

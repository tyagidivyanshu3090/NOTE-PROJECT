# Emmet in VS Code

Emmet is a powerful toolkit for web developers, built right into **Visual Studio Code**. It enables lightning-fast HTML and CSS workflows using shorthand syntax known as _Emmet abbreviations_.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Emmet?

Emmet allows you to generate large chunks of HTML or CSS using short expressions. These expressions are expanded into full code blocks when you press **Enter** or **Tab**, saving time and reducing repetitive typing.
